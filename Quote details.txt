import React from 'react';

const QuoteDetails = ({ quote }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h3>Quote Details</h3>
      <p>Price: {quote.price}</p>
      <p>Description: {quote.description}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default QuoteDetails;
In this example, the quote details component receives the quote data as a prop and displays the relevant information for the quote. This component could be used to display quote details when a user selects a quote from the job details page.

Note that these examples assume that you have set up a back-end API using a framework like Adonis.js and that you have defined the necessary endpoints for creating quotes and retrieving quote details. The components also assume that you have configured routing using a library like React Router to navigate between different pages in the application.
