In this example, the job list component uses the useState and useEffect hooks to manage the state of the job data and fetch the data from the /api/jobs endpoint when the component is mounted. The component then maps over the jobs array and displays the relevant information for each job.

Note that these examples assume that you have set up a back-end API using a framework like Adonis.js and that you have defined the necessary endpoints for creating orders and retrieving jobs. The components also assume that you have configured routing using a library like React Router to navigate between different pages in the application.
